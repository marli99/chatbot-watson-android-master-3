# Soothwell
Soothwell is my application's name and it is mental health care application.
Soothwell is embended with a chatbot with whom users can talk to about their mental health problems. 
the chat bot is names Gill and she can also give users contact details if they wish to talk to a profesional.

# Concept

I got my inspiration from the app called WYSA, it is a app used to help people with anxiety and get them to calm down. And because I struggle with anxiety and depression i wanted to create a similiar application but with various options for the user to choose from to talk about and work on.

# Technologies used
I used android studio platform
Java programming language
Firebase for database
IBM Watson - assistant
           - Speech to text
           - Text to speech
           
# Features

Audio functionality that works almost like a voicenot, recording user making it speech to text for chat bot to understand
Text to speech functionality sothat AI can not just send messages but read them and by doing so talking and making normal conversation to the user
